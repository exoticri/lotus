# lotus

lotus is a repository aiming to power both my last.fm projects [bleh](https://cutensilly.org/bleh/fm) and [bwaa](https://cutensilly.org/bwaa/fm) to have a unified correction system.

## what is the 'correction system'?

last.fm's catalogue of artists, albums, and tracks all work by people scrobbling. the first to scrobble an item, will decide its capitalisation. this can often be incorrect and to combat this last.fm has a system to correct these themselves.

however unfortunately it takes them a *long* time, trust me i would know. as a sort of bridge to fill this current gap, bleh offers it's own correction system powered entirely by community contributions in the issues tab. with lotus i am to bundle this into one repository that is not necessarily tied to a single project, with the added benefit of allowing updates to these systems without full project updates.

## how do i contribute corrections?

simply [create a new issue right here](https://github.com/katelyynn/lotus/issues/new/choose) :3

## what if 2 or more share a same name?

in these common instances i base this on the most popular usage. for example, in the silly case of [funeral](https://www.last.fm/music/Funeral), the top tracks very obviously match the Spotify page of [*this* funeral](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3f0Mhz0oXmnsnehuEGTrfd?si=LpV8APuLRmClhZ5A98JPQQ) (despite the vocal minority who shout about the other *Funeral*). i believe this is the best workaround to appeal to the majority until last.fm can separate these pages themselves.

in the future, it may be possible to set per-user corrections within the projects (bleh and bwaa) which integrate this correction system.
